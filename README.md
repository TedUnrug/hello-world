# hello-world
This is a web application testing project.

Hi Guys!

I'm a software tester who started testing career in Travel Industry. 
I'm involved in testing mainly web applications, mainly the CRM system for travel agencies. 
Besides testing, I like playing different instruments, e.g guitar, drums, etc., rollerblading, mountain journeys, playing computer games and driving a car (that's so relaxing). 
I love meeting new people!
